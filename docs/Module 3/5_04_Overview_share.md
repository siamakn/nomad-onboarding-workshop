## **Sharing your progress and outcomes**

Finally, it is essential to share your progress and findings with others. This involves keeping your collaborators updated on your latest experiments and enabling them to record their own experiments. By fostering open communication and collaboration, researchers can benefit from shared insights and collective expertise, accelerating the pace of scientific discovery and innovation.

NOMAD allows you share your ELNs with your PI, collaborators, and the community.
