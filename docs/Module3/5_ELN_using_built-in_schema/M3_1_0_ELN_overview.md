<!-- ## Creating an Electronic Lab Notebook using NOMAD built-in ELN schema -->

<!-- SN: I suggest to combine the whole Overview section with its subsections in a single longer md file. This way reader sees less nested subsections and does not have to go over multiple short pages. They can navigate through subsections by the table of contents at the right side of the deployed page.
I combine it already in a new md file M3_1_0_overview2.md, but keep the old files and just comment them out in mkdocs.yaml to decide.

# Overview

An Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) is an essential tool for today's scientists, providing a reliable, searchable record of all experimental activities and measurements. Compared to traditional paper-based lab notebooks, ELNs offer significant advantages, including direct access to your research data from any device, seamless integration of measurements and key findings with detailed experimental metadata, and enhanced collaboration capabilities with colleagues and external partners.

## Why Use an ELN?

- **Searchability:** Instantly locate and retrieve samples and experimental details.
- **Organization:** Store all experimental data, from raw measurements to metadata, in one place.
- **Collaboration:** Easily share and manage projects with your team.
- **Security:** Ensure your data is backed up and protected from loss or damage.

## Typical Experimentation Processes

- **Planning:** Plan your experiment by identifying resources and outlining your process.
- **Documenting:** Record each step of your experiment, including materials, procedures, and results.
- **Managing:** Organize your data, notes, and materials for systematic access and review.
- **Sharing:** Collaborate with others by sharing your progress and results within the ELN.
