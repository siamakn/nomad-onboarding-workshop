## Setting up your programming environment
To use NOMAD programmatically, you need to set up an appropriate programming environment. 

??? note "what is a programming environment?"
    A programming environment refers to the setup and tools required for developing and running software. It includes both the hardware and software components that provide a workspace for coding, testing, and executing programs.

There are two suggested approaches:

1.  **Local installation**: Download and install Python 3 along with the required libraries on your machine.
2.  **Cloud-based solutions**: Alternatively, cloud platforms offer convenient, ready-to-use environments. Among several options, we suggest the [NOMAD Remote Tools Hub (NORTH)](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/gui/analyze/north) as it offers an optimized experience tailored to NOMAD users.

<!-- How about adding a paragraph here on which approach we will be using in this workhsop. You can say that we will introduce both and focus mainly on .... while some examples on using "that" will included -->
