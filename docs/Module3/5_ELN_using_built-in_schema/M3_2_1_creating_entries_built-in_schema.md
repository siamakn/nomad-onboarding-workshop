# Creating NOMAD entries using the ELN built-in ELN schemas
In this section, you will learn how to use NOMAD's built-in ELN schemas to create entries of entities and activities in your experiment.

After planning for your experiments, you would start by documenting your experimental work. This involves creating a record of all the materials and instruments that will be used during your experiment, or **entities**. In addition, the conditions under which the materials will be processed and the methods of measurement will be outlined, i.e., **activities**

This record in NOMAD is made by creating entries for each entity and activity that will be used in your experiments.

### **Step 1:** Create a new upload for the electronic lab note book for the experiments. This upload will be your ELN of the planned experiment.

### **Step 2:** Create an **entry** using NOMAD's built-in schema.

## What is next?
In the following sections, we will apply these general procedures to create entries for a sample ELN focused on the solution processing of organic materials. As we work through this example, we'll explore the various built-in schemas and the specific quantities they provide for "input".
