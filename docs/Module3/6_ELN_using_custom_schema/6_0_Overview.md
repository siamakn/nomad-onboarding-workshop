<!-- ## Creating an Electronic Lab Notebook using Custom schema -->

# Overview
## **Introduction**

In the previous section, we have demonstrated how NOMAD can be used as an ELN using the built-in schema provided by NOMAD. 

The NOMAD built-in ELN schema are very general, which can be limiting with respect to the fact the the available input fields may not cover all the quantities that a research would like to be processed into the strucutred data model in NOMAD. 

For this reason, NOMAD offers the opportunity for creating ELN templates that are tailored to the needs of specific researchers. These templates are created based on the schema language of NOMAD, i.e. the NOMAD metainfo. 

In this section you will learn:
How to create an ELN template using YAML files.
The data strcuture of NOMAD. 
How to control the interactivity of different fields in your ELN.
