# Authentication and Checking Uploads

## Authentication <!-- Authentication: Who you are? Authorization: Are you allowed to perfrom the actions?>

Most of the API operations with NOMAD can be freely used without needing a login or credentials. However, to upload, edit, or view your own data or those shared with you, you'll need to log in to authenticate your identity.

The NOMAD API uses OAuth and tokens to authenticate users. This guide will show you how to get access tokens, use the NOMAD Python package to log in, and manage app tokens.

??? note "What is OAuth?"

    OAuth is an open standard for access delegation commonly used as a way to grant websites or applications limited access to user information without exposing passwords. It allows third-party services to exchange information securely and efficiently.

??? note "What are Tokens?"

    Tokens are pieces of data that are used to authorize access to an API. In the NOMAD API, tokens are used to authenticate users. There are two main types of tokens:
        1. **Access Tokens**: Short-lived tokens used for API requests.
        2. **App Tokens**: Tokens with a user-defined expiration time, used for longer sessions.

You will need to authenticate yourself using you username and password in the following use cases:

- Using the API dashboard
- Interacting with NOMAD API using python.
- Working with the NOMAD python package. <!-- I don't get what is meant here -->

<!-- These seem to be different methods to acquire the authorization token, correct? 
I recommend that we only use one method to prevent distraction. I would go with using the NORTH platform. We can mention that there are other ways and refer to the documentation --> 
1. To use authentication in the [API dashboard](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/api/v1/extensions/docs), simply use the "Authorize" button
![Authenticate in the API Dashboard](../images/API_dashboard_auth.gif)

2. When interacting with NOMAD using python you need access tokens. You can obtain access tokens by sending a GET request to the NOMAD authentication endpoint (/auth/token', see the [API dashboard](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/api/v1/extensions/docs)). In the following example, we first obtain our access token from the `/auth/token` endpoint, and use it later as a `header` parameter when sending other requests. Simply replace 'myname' and 'mypassword' with your actual username and password and run it. 

```python
import requests
import json

response = requests.get(
    'https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/api/v1/auth/token', 
    params=dict(username='myname', password='mypassword')
)

token = response.json()['access_token']
```

??? tip "App tokens"
    If the short-term expiration of the default access token (obtained from the `/auth/token` endpoint) does not suit your needs, you can request an app token with a user-defined expiration from the `/auth/app_token` endpoint:

    ```python
    response = requests.get(
    'https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/api/v1/auth/app_token?expires_in=86400',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'})
    app_token = response.json()['access_token']
    ```

3. If you have the [NOMAD Python package](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/howto/programmatic/pythonlib.html) installed, you can use its `Auth` implementation to directly authenticate yourself in the requests you send. Here is an example on how the username and password is given, when using the `Auth` e.g., to to see the user uploads:


```python
import requests
from nomad.client import Auth

response = requests.get(
    'https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/api/v1/uploads',
    auth=Auth(user='myname or email', password='mypassword')
)
uploads = response.json()['data']


```

## Checking You Uploads in NOMAD

In this section, you'll learn how to check the uploads the you have created in your NOMAD account. The process involves two main steps:

1. **Obtain an Access Token.** 
In this step, you will send a GET request to the NOMAD API's token endpoint to authenticate your self. The code used in this step consists of four parts:
    - Use the `requests.get()`.
    - Specify the relevant endpoint to obtain the token, i.e., `/auth/token`.
    - You pass your username and password as query parameters `params`, asking the API for an access token.
    - You will need to extracts the `access_token` field from the response and store it in the `token` variable. This token will be used for further API requests.

```python
import requests
import json

response = requests.get(
    'https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/api/v1/auth/token', params=dict(username='my_username', password='my_password'))

token = response.json()['access_token']
```

2. **Retrieve Your Uploads:**
Next, you'll use the access token to send a GET request to the NOMAD API's uploads endpoint. This will provide you with information about your uploads, which weâ€™ll then print out for easy viewing. The code used in this step consists of points:
    - Use the `requests.get()`.
    - Specify the relevant endpoint to check your uploads, i.e., `/uploads`.
    - Include the authorization token in the `header` of your request. 
    - Extract and print the information about your uploads included `data` field from the response.

```python
response = requests.get(
    'https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/api/v1/uploads',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
)
uploads = response.json()['data']
print(json.dumps(uploads, indent = 4))

```

The output of the above snippet should look like the following. It is a python list with several elements (in this example only 1). Each element is a JSON (or python dict) containing information about each of your uploads.

```JSON
[
    {
        "process_running": false,
        "current_process": "process_upload",
        "process_status": "SUCCESS",
        "last_status_message": "Process process_upload completed successfully",
        "errors": [],
        "warnings": [],
        "complete_time": "2024-07-16T13:57:53.459000",

        "coauthors": [],
        "coauthor_groups": [],
        "reviewers": [],
        "reviewer_groups": [],
        "writers": [
            "ebb26223-0cec-4d81-98f5-3b25db945b54"
        ],
        "writer_groups": [],
        "viewers": [
            "ebb26223-0cec-4d81-98f5-3b25db945b54"
        ],
        "viewer_groups": [],
        "published": false,
        "published_to": [],
        "with_embargo": false,
        "embargo_length": 0,
        "license": "CC BY 4.0",
        "entries": 0,
        "upload_files_server_path": "/nomad/prod/fs/staging/V/VWGLXmy4S2-cdeteN2Xxaw"
    }
]

```

Next we will explore how we can use other API endpoints to create datasets and upload files.
