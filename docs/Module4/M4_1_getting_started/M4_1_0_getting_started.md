## Setting up your programming environment
In order to use NOMAD programmatically, you need to set up an appropriate programming environment. For this purpose, there are two suggested approaches to consider:

1.  **Local Installation**: This method involves downloading and installing Python 3 along with any required libraries on your own machine.
2.  **Cloud-based solutions**: Alternatively, cloud platforms offer convenient, ready-to-use environments. Among several options, we suggest the [NOMAD Remote Tools Hub (NORTH)](https://www.anaconda.com/download) as it offers an optimized experience tailored to NOMAD users.
