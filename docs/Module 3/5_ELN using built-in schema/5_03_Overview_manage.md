### **Managing your expriments**

After carefully planning your experiments and thoroughly documenting all entities and activities involved, the next crucial step is to effectively manage their execution. Efficient experiment management is essential for maintaining organization and ensuring the quality of research outcomes.

In NOMAD, the process involves integrating multiple records into a single experiment, establishing a clear workflow, and creating comprehensive connections to all entries using the built-in schemas. NOMAD also facilitates recording and analyzing data. By using NOMAD's features, researchers can streamline the experimental process, ensuring accurate documentation, efficient workflow management, and thorough analysis. This leads to robust and reliable research outcomes.
