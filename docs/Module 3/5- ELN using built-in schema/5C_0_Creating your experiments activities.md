## Creating an Electronic Lab Notebook using NOMAD built-in ELN schema

### Create the activities of your experiments:

Now that you have created the record for the entities of your experiments, the next step is to create the activities involved in your experiments.

Activities include:
1. Sample preparation
2. Characterizing the samples

We will first document the preparation procedure for our samples, i.e. the P3HT in chloroform solvent and the P3HT thin film on glass. 
For this we will use the built-in ELN schema *materials processing ELN*. 

This schema allows the processes to be linked to the equipment used, the substances used as input materials, and the samples resulting from the process. 

In addition, workflows can be automatically created and modified to allow a visual graph that represents the process. 

[Click here](5C_1_Materials%20processing%20activity.md) for a step-by-step illustration of how to create an activity record using the *Materials Processing ELN* schema, and an explanation of the different features that can be used.
