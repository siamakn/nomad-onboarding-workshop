# Creating an Electronic Lab Notebook using NOMAD built-in ELN schema

## **Create Measurement activities using the *measurement ELN* schema**

In this section you will learn how to create NOMAD entries for activities that will be used to describe the measurements in your experiments. You will use the NOMAD built-in schema called *Measurement ELN* and explore the various fields you can fill in and the information you can add to NOMAD.

Based on the example described earlier, we will need to create entries for the following processes:
1. Measuring the optical absorption spectra.

2. Measuring the electrical conductivity.

For general steps on how to create records in NOMAD using the built-in ELN schema, please refer to the [Getting started](5A_0_Getting_started.md) page. When you reach step 8, select *Measurement ELN* from the drop down menu, enter a name for your record, and click Create.
